Android Nanodegree Popular Movies project

This project is part of Udacity's Android Nanodegree program. The app fetches a list of popular/top rated movies from The Movie DB (https://www.themoviedb.org), displays these in a grid and also offers a detailed movie view when selecting a movie.
In order to use this app, an API key for the Movie DB is required. The key has to be inserted into the following file:
/app/src/main/java/android/chribru/dev/popularmovies/data/Constants.java
There you can find a static String variable called API_KEY.

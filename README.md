# Android Nanodegree Popular Movies project

This project is part of Udacity's Android Nanodegree program. The app fetches a list of popular/top rated movies from The Movie DB (https://www.themoviedb.org), displays these in a grid and also offers a detailed movie view when selecting a movie.
In order to use this app, an API key for the Movie DB is required. The key has to be inserted as part of a file named "api_key" that should be placed in the root of the project. The content should follow the format "theMovieDbKey = ..." (without quotes, replacing the dots with your key).
